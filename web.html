            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                The world-famous Paradise brand has its origins in a small
                Canteen and a Café in a cinema theatre called Paradise in
                Secunderabad in the Year 1953. A small 100-seater restaurant
                started serving typical Hyderabadi cuisine like Biryani etc.
                from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food
                items to the people as a one-stop Food Store. In 1978, Mr A
                Hemati took complete charge of the Restaurant from his Father &
                Uncle and set about renovating the Restaurant to suit the
                changing social trends and the evolving food habits of people in
                India. In 1983 an Air-cooled multi-cuisine Restaurant called
                Paradise Persis Family Restaurant and the highly popular
                Paradise Takeaway came up at Secunderabad.
