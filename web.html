            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                The world-famous Paradise brand has its origins in a small
                Canteen and a Café in a cinema theatre called Paradise in
                Secunderabad in the Year 1953. A small 100-seater restaurant
                started serving typical Hyderabadi cuisine like Biryani etc.
                from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food
                items to the people as a one-stop Food Store. In 1978, Mr A
                Hemati took complete charge of the Restaurant from his Father &
                Uncle and set about renovating the Restaurant to suit the
                changing social trends and the evolving food habits of people in
                India. In 1983 an Air-cooled multi-cuisine Restaurant called
                Paradise Persis Family Restaurant and the highly popular
                Paradise Takeaway came up at Secunderabad. In 1987 the Paradise
                theatre and consequently the Canteen was closed. But the Café
                and Restaurant continued its operations.
